This document describes various common challenges that you may encounter
while developing a native C/C++ application for Android. Index:

1. Cleaning the project directory to the bare minimum
2. Add additional source / header files to the project
3. Add additional assets to the project
4. Renaming the project / apk
5. Changing the application icon
6. Creating a signed 'release' apk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CLEANING THE PROJECT DIRECTORY

After cleaning the project directory, it will contain the smallest
set of files that will still correctly build in Android Studio. 

- This set is the set that should be checked in to SVN or Git. 
- It is also the perfect starting point for renaming the project.

Android Studio lets you 'clean' your folder. However, using the
following steps, a much smaller set of files is obtained:

- Close down Android Studio.
- Clean the project directory by executing clean.bat.
- Open the project directory in Android Studio.

The last step results in a warning about Gradle. Press OK to restore the
gradle folder; after this the project will build without problems.

2. Add additional source / header files to the project

3. ADDING ASSETS

In the folder app/src/main you can find a folder named 'assets'. Add
any files you wish to include in your apk to this folder. Note that the
template currently supports loading png files using the picopng code in
template.cpp, and wav files via the included 'soloud' library.

3. RENAMING THE PROJECT

Carefully execute each of the following steps to rename your project:

- Close down Android Studio.
- Clean the project directory by executing clean.bat.
- Create a backup of the directory.
- Rename the project directory to the desired name, e.g. 'MyProject'.
- Replace the string 'Tmpl8App' by 'MyProject' in 5 files:

settings.gradle
app/build.gradle
app/CMakeLists.txt
app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml

- Open the renamed folder in Android Studio.

Optionally, uninstall the application with the old name on your
device.
